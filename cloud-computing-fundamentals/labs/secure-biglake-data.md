# Secure BigLake Data

you receive the following request to complete the following tasks:
- Create a BigLake table from an existing file on Cloud Storage.
- Apply and verify policy tags to restrict access to columns containing sensitive data.
- Remove direct IAM permissions to Cloud Storage for other users (after policy tags have been applied to protect the data).

Some standards you should follow:
- Ensure that any needed APIs (such as Data Catalog and BigQuery Connection API) are successfully enabled and that necessary service accounts have the appropriate permissions.
- Create all resources in the multiple regions in United States, unless otherwise directed.
